  <h2> About Me </h2>

<!--paragraph with bold-->
  
  <p><b>The pace at which the changes are happening,  It needs continuous learning.
   The competitiveness among frameworks which is healthy and brings the best out of 
   them</b>!
  </p> 
  <p><b>The major thing that dragged me into web development is the ability to 
   solve problems. I am really passionate about Web Development and something that 
   really sparks joy is being able to work and collaborate with like minded people.
   Being someone who really loves art and all forms of art expression like music and 
   painting, coding has its own rhythm, beat and color. Once you start picking it up 
   you'll notice you'll be making beautiful art</b>.
